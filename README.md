## Refractoring website project using semantic elements and connecting them to CSS.

The goal of this project was refractor a website using semantic elements. I simplified the html and CSS and replaced it with code that is easier to read and follow. This project allowed me to grow my skills as a coder. I simplified overyly complex code and fixed internal page links so that the page is more assessable for navigation. I added alt attributes to the images to make the content more assessable. 

In addition, I replaced div with the following semantic elements: -header -footer -main -section -article -aside.
 
 Using semantic elements made the html code easier to read and allowed . The CSS had repeating style elements that were simplified by using references to semantic elements used in the updated html. I learned a lot through trial and error. I believe this experience has helped me build skills needed to be a great web developer. I am ready to take these skills and apply them to future code refractoring projects.

 This project is significant because the website code is improved from the significantly from the original website. It should be noted that I frequently pushed my work to github with comments.
